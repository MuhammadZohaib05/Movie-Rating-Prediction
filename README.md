## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview  
The goal of this task was to build a predictive model that estimates how a user might rate a movie they havenâ€™t seen yet. The dataset includes information about movies such as ratings, genres, revenue, directors, and release years.  

We followed the given outline to perform **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling**. The task demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied in the entertainment industry for recommendations and trend analysis.

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and duplicate records.  
   - Converted columns into correct data types.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Top 10 movies by rating and revenue.  
   - Most common genres and directors.  
   - Yearly trends in movie production and ratings.  
   - Correlation analysis using heatmaps.  

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Count plots, bar charts, and line charts.  
   - Genre and director distributions.  
   - Revenue and rating comparisons.  

4. **Model Building**  
   - Applied Collaborative Filtering / Regression approaches.  
   - Predicted user ratings for unseen movies.  
   - Evaluated performance with metrics such as RMSE/MAE.  

5. **Additional Analysis**  
   - WordCloud for genres.  
   - Correlation deep dive with revenue and ratings.
